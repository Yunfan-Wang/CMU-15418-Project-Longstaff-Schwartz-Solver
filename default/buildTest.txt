Make (start from /longstaff):
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

Test:
--S0 100 --K 100 --r 0.05 --sigma 0.2 --T 1.0 --paths 50000 --steps 50 --put

Sample explanation:
S0 = 100	Current stock price is 100
K = 100	Strike price is 100
r = 5%	Risk-free interest rate is 5%
sigma = 20%	Volatility of the stock is 20%
T = 1.0	Option matures in 1 year
paths = 50000	Monte Carlo uses 50k simulated stock paths
steps = 50	Each path has 50 time points (discrete exercise opportunities)
--put	We are pricing a put (not a call)
